## Proposal

Proposed by a company as part of a selection process (Take Home Assignment), the aim of the project was to create an exploratory data analysis using fictitious data provided by the company. For this challenge, the idea was to carry out an exploratory analysis in order to better understand the distribution and quality of the data provided, and then use this data as a guide for a strategy to increase the company's profits. In the end, the statistics provided by the airlines with the best and worst results were analyzed to promote a quicker task force-style action strategy.

## Dataset

Fictitious data provided by the company. For the analysis in question, only the dataset "assignment-airlines-dataset"

For comparison purposes, I included the original dataset ("assignment-airlines-dataset-original) exactly as it was sent by the company. But the analyzed dataset has two extra columns: cancellation_percentage and profit.

## Results and conclusion
